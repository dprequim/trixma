<p><strong>Ad Choices. </strong>We may work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our Sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on and off our Sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They may also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.</p>

<p>For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and/or the DAA <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>. To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please download the version of <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank">AppChoices</a> for your device <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.</p>

<p><strong>Precise location information</strong>. To disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.</p>

<p><strong>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cookies and other technologies.</strong> We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to understand and enhance your online experience at our Sites and through our advertising and media across the Internet and mobile apps.</p>

<p>Cookies are small text files placed in your browser. We may also use pixels or "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the web beacon, and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. We may also integrate “Software Development Kits” (“SDKs”) into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.</p>

<p>We may use cookies and other technologies to help recognize your browser or device, maintain your preferences, provide certain Site features, and collect Information about interactions with our Sites, our content, and our communications. For example, when corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons and other technologies let us know about your activity, including whether you received and opened our email, clicked through a link, or otherwise interacted with our content, and this information may be associated with Information previously collected.</p>

<p>We may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Sites, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Sites and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services. Cookies and other technologies also facilitate, manage, and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.</p>

<p><strong>Managing cookies and other technologies.</strong> Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Check your browser settings to learn how to delete cookies.</p>

<p>You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult your browser’s settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features.</p>

<p>Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (“LSOs”) to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user experience. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Adobe's web site</a>. Your browser may also offer other tools to delete or reject other LSOs; please check your browser’s settings or help menu for more information.</p>

<p>Some of our sites may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage</a>. To opt-out of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Sites, you can download and install the Browser Plugin available via this link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

<p>We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#yourchoices">Your Choices</a> section to learn how to control data collection for certain purposes.</p>
<br /><a class="anchor" id="infosec" name="infosec"></a><b>INFORMATION SECURITY</b>

<p>We have put in place reasonable controls designed to help safeguard the personal information we collect via the Sites. However, no security measures are perfect and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in in an unauthorized way.</p>
<br /><a class="anchor" id="accesscorrect" name="accesscorrect"></a><strong>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION</strong>

<p>To access the personal information that we have collected about you online from Sites on which this Privacy Policy is posted or to update your user profile, please log into your account if you have created one with us or send an email to <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4c4c6ddc2d5d7cdf4c3d69ad7dbd9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fd8d8f948b9c9e84bd8a9fd39e9290">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<br /><a class="anchor" id="childprivacy" name="childprivacy"></a><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong>

<p>Visitors to this Site may participate in many activities without providing any personal information. However, in some cases if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we may ask the user to register and/or provide us with the user's age information and, in some cases, email address. If the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g. email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address. We use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information from the child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent. If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. If you would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this personal information deleted from our active servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's personal information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bcccced5cadddfc5fccbde92dfd3d1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2f5f5d46594e4c566f584d014c4042">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or at Warner Bros. Privacy Office, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 3, Burbank, CA 91522.</p>
<br /><a class="anchor" id="intltransfer" name="intltransfer"></a><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</strong>

<p>We operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, this means Information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you use or visit our Sites from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of Information we collect from you.</p>
<br /><a class="anchor" id="updatenotify" name="updatenotify"></a><strong>NOTIFICATION REGARDING UPDATES</strong>

<p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by placing a notice on our Sites. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always know our current privacy practices.</p>
